> [!WARNING]  
> Clamav Desktop is a work in progress. I do not recommend using older releases (`<v0.4.0`)
> as they were based on Electron, which can be slow for this type of application.  
> **Please wait for the release of `v0.4.0`** . This version will be released soon
> and is expected to offer tremendous improvements over the previous ones.

> [!NOTE]  
> This README is for _users_ rather than _contributors_.**  
> If you wish to _contribute_ to ClamAV Desktop, you should read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) instead.
